Consider a linear iteration
$$ Z_{j+1} = \psi Z_{j} \space ; j = 0,1,2,3 $$
Is :
- Stable 
	$$ \sup_{j \ge 1}|| \psi ^{j} ||< \infty \space $$
- Asymtotische Stability
	$$ \lim_{j \to \infty} || \psi ^{j} || = 0   $$
- Spectral Radius of a Matrix 
	It is the maximum value of Eigen vector set. 

- Stability of Linear iteration.
	 Linear Iteration is stable when spectral radius **less than OR EQUAL TO** one and the EW of 1 occur only once. 
- Asymtopicstability of Linear iteration.
	 Linear Iteration is stable when spectral radius **less than **
